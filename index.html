            <h3>Northbound</h3>
            <p>The Northbound scenario is described as follows:<br>
            o A single remote source, like a UxV, with multiple 
            networks to a central receiver.
            o It is basically a one-to-one connection,
             but with multiple network paths in
            between. The remote source has a satcom on at 
            least one of the network
            connections.<br>
            o The single user source may have multiple data types,
             like video streams and clips,
            photos, documents and more.

               Satellite communication is available anywhere on earth, 
               allowing connectivity to systems like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)
                in very remote geographical areas. However, satellite airtime
                 is expensive, and a reduction of the amount of transmitted data 
                 can lead to significant cost savings. 
                 The goal of the Highly-Efficient Network Coding 
                 for Satellite Applications (HENCSAT) project is to reduce such 
                 costs by using our approach Network Coding with Torrents (NECTOR). 
                 NECTOR combines network coding, Torrent-based transmission, 
                 and H.265 highly efficient video encoding. In our demonstration, 
                 we would like to 
               showcase NECTOR in an interactive HENCSAT test bench setup.
               
            Drones use sensors (for example video) which also act as the payload.
            Streaming video requires good communication channel and drones fly to remote areas.
            Satcom is both expensive and limited in capacity, so use also Cellular.
            Combination of networks leads to performance imporovenets but is challenging.
            MPTCP was used for this, but faces challenges such as head-of-line-blocking.
            Network conditions change rapidly, for each network individually
