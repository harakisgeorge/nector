         <li>☂ Address the challenge of providing resilient communications for UAVs that are equipped with multiple networks with varying coverage and capacity. </li>
         <li>☂ Tackle the above challenges using two key
            : torrents and Network Coding (NC)</li>
         <li>☂ The torrent-based strategy requires no additional rate adaptation per network, since it is driven by the packet requests from the
            receivers. </li>
         <li>☂ No need for designing an efficient scheduler to distribute and
            track packets when NC is used, since linear combinations of the same packets are sent instead
            of uncoded packets.</li>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Description: At the source there are datagrams that are transmitted using torrent technology. 
               Datagram is segmented into chunks. Chunks are segmented into slices. Chunks sizes listed as n (bytes).

            <h3>Network coding</h3>
            <p> Network Coding (NC) is used in mobility management and load balancing by 
               considering multiple networks with at least one satellite and other terrestrial components.
               Chunk NC generation: is some chunks, chosen from a field of chunks.
                  The encoder can generate a fountain of (coded) chunks and stop transmission only when it receives the signal from the
                  receiver. 
                  Slice NC generation:
                  In both cases, we assume each coded chunk is generated by a linear combination of the chunk
                  NC generation with coding coefficients from either deterministically or randomly chosen
                  columns of Pascal matrices of size.

            <h3>Torrents</h3>
            <p>Torrent file that describes the hash table, which contains key values of chunks, is sent to the
               receiver.
               Assures the verification of integrity and authenticity. 
              
              Torrents have a receiver-driven method, randomly asking for chunks from the sender. (load balancing) 
              This also removes complexity from the sender.
           
              Torrents use UDP.
              NECTOR ensures reliability at the application layer through Network Coding.
          
              More specific: for every file a (virtual) replica is created for every network the sender is
              connected to, and thus this equals a seeder on each network.
         
           The torrent file with  is created and the packets are “network coded”
           The torrent-file (incl Hash Table) is sent to the Receiver side where the Torrent Client “asks” for this file from the Seeders.
            Every available network will have a copy (it can be the same file as
              they are all connected to the same source), and transmission starts.</p>
