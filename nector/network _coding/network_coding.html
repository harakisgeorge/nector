                  Network Coding (NC) is used in mobility management and load balancing by 
                  considering multiple networks with at least one satellite and other terrestrial components.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Chunk NC generation: is some chunks, chosen from a field of chunks.
                  The encoder can generate a fountain of (coded) chunks and stop transmission only when it receives the signal from the
                  receiver. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  Slice NC generation:
                  In both cases, we assume each coded chunk is generated by a linear combination of the chunk
                  NC generation with coding coefficients from either deterministically or randomly chosen
                  columns of Pascal matrices �- of size � × �, see [10].
