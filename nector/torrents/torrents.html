   <h2>Torrents</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Torrent file that describes the hash table, which contains key values of chunks, is sent to the
          receiver.
          Assures the verification of integrity and authenticity. 
         </li>
      <li>
         Torrents have a receiver-driven method, randomly asking for chunks from the sender. (load balancing) 
         This also removes complexity from the sender.
      </li>
      <li>
         Torrents use UDP.
         NECTOR ensures reliability at the application layer through Network Coding.
      </li>
      <li>
         More specific: for every file a (virtual) replica is created for every network the sender is
         connected to, and thus this equals a seeder on each network.
      </li>
      <li>The torrent file with  is created and the packets are “network coded”</li>
      <li>The torrent-file (incl Hash Table) is sent to the Receiver side where the Torrent Client “asks” for this file from the Seeders.</li>
       <li>Every available network will have a copy (it can be the same file as
         they are all connected to the same source), and transmission starts.</li>
   </ul>
