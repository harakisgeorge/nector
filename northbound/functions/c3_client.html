         <p>– it is responsible for requesting more chunks from the relevant seeder.
            It also communicates with the NECTOR Fixed Tracker for being aware of the seeder
            status. It sends the received chunk to the NECTOR decoder.</p>

         <li class="list-title">NECTOR Client Manager</li>
         <li>Client Manager has two functionalities</li>
         <li>1 - Communicating with Operating System Kernel: creates a Netlink socket that is used
            for communication between the kernel and the application. Whenever the networks
            are up or down, the operating system Kernel notifies the NECTOR Client Manager, by seeing which IPs are on.</li>
         <li>2 - Creating/Removing NECTOR Peers (Seeders) As soon as the list of available IP
            addresses are received from the operating system kernel, the NECTOR Client manager
            creates/removes the different instances of the Peers depending on the available IP
            addresses.  </li>

         <li class="list-title">NECTOR Peer</li>
         <li>Created by the NECTOR Manager</li>
         <li>Parameters:IP address, UDP port, TCP port number,</li>
         <li>NECTOR peer functionalities</li>
         <li>1 - Receiving Chunk requests – A NECTOR Peer (Seeder) receives a chunk request from
            other NECTOR Peers. The chunk request contains the IP address and the UDP port
            number of the downloading Peer in order for Seeder to send the chunks to the
            downloading Peer via UDP.</li>
            <li>2 - Communication with NECTOR Encoder – The NECTOR Peer (Seeder) asks NECTOR
               Encoder for a new chunk via “send new chunks” message. The NECTOR encoder sends
               the new chunk to the NECTOR Peer (Seeder). The Seeder sends the new chunk to the
               corresponding Leecher. </li>
            <li>3 - Sending chunk to the Chunk Sender – Each NECTOR Peer (Seeder) has its
               corresponding Chunk Sender. The Chunk is sent to the Chunk Sender for further
               processing. </li>

            <li>Communication with NECTOR Fixed Tracker (Figure above) – Peers send Client-Tracker
               requests to NECTOR Fixed Tracker.</li>
            <li>Client-Tracker contains: Client ID, Peer IP, timestamp, status,</li>

      </ul>
