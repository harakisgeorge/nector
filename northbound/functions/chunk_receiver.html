         <li class="list-title">Chunk receiver sub - functionalities</li>
         <li class="underline"></li>
         <li>1 - Send/Receive Function:  slices are received over UDP, send/receive function
            gets inputs from NECTOR Client send/receive function
            gets inputs from NECTOR Client on the PEER local IP address and PEER UDP/TCP port
            numbers. </li>
         <li>2 - NC Progressive Decoder (Optional for NC as FEC): NC as FEC at slice-level is optional. </li>
         <li>3 - Grouping Slices into Generations (Optional for NC as FEC): The slices are re-grouped
            in generations where the signaling information (generation size, slice length, etc.) are
            received with slice headers.</li>
         <li>4 - Chunk Constructor: It creates chunks from the received slices and sent them to the
            NECTOR client.</li>
