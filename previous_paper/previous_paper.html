            <ul>
               <li>
                  Small scale testbed to evaluate the performance of 
                  NECTOR over off-the-shelf products that can be used 
                  in UAVs. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  We will run four scenarios, but each scenario, has these 
                  same characteristics

               </li>
               <li>Network 1 satellite link while networks 2 and 3 
                  are configured as low bandwidth cellular links, 
                  mimicking 2G/3G coverage in rural areas. 
               </li>
               <li>Network 1 is always available while networks 2 and 
                  3 availability (cellular links) vary over time. 
                  The on/off time duration is configured such as network 2 
                  is available (66.67%) and network 3 is hardly available 
                  (33.33% of total time) in scenarios 1, 2 , 3. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  Scenario 1: emulating fast bandwidth variations
              </li>
              <li>Scenario 3: emulating slow bandwidth variations.</li>
              <li>Scenarios 1,2,3: all three networks are available 
                 at the start of the experiments. 
              </li>
              <li>Last scenario: time duration varies randomly between 
                 1 and 10 seconds. 
              </li>


              <li>The total time taken to transfer a datagram from the sender
               to the receiver is given by T (in s).
              </li>
              <li>The application layer performance is defined as goodput (g), 
                 as the number of useful information (n) delivered at the 
                 receiver per unit of time: 
                 g = (8 * n)/T. 
              </li>
              <li>The unitilization ratio(th) is given as the goodput divided
                 by the sum of the total bandwidth of all networks: 
              </li>
              <li>The receiver has f interfaces corresponding to f networks 
                 where n as is the number of bytes received, and n as is 
                 the number of bytes sent by the ith interface of the sender. 
                 The total number of bytes at the reciever are n(all), where
                 overhead (h ) is defined as additional bytes n(all) minus n(d)
                 divided by the datagram size n(d)

                 h = ( n(all) - n(d) ) / n(d)

              </li>

              <li>Finally, we also define network traffic load shared by the i(ith)
                 network 
                 
              </li>

              <li>Results: </li>
              <li>Optimal selection of n: First, select low n's , such as 
                 32 and 48, because a huge amount chunks are creating trouble 
                 at the encoder and decoder.
              </li>
              <li>Performance evaluation for different scenarios with 
                 on/off model: 
              </li>
         
      </ul>
